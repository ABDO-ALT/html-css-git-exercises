### Set up the project

Before you can start the exercises, we must set up the project. To do this, we will install all of the code necessary to run the exercises. In your editor, open the Terminal and run the following commands:

```
npm install
```

Carefully read the messages that appear. Are there any errors? If so, please ask a mentor for help.

### Begin working on the exercises

To begin working on the first exercise, run the following command in the Terminal in your code editor:

```
npm run 1
```

This will lauch the sample website for the first exercise in your browser.

Now go back to your code editor. Open the first exercise directory, [1-getting-started](1-getting-started), and find the [readme.md](1-getting-started/readme.md) file.

Read the instructions in this file and follow the steps to complete the exercise.

### Completing more exercises

When you have finished the first exercise, move to the next one. First, go to the Terminal in your code editor, and type `CTRL`+`C` (`CMD`+`C` on a Mac) to stop running the first exercise.

To run another exercise, run the following code with the correct number of that exercise:

```
npm run 2
```

## When you have completed all exercises

When you reach the final exercise, you'll be asked to submit a pull request. When you've finished that task, post in your Slack channel to let the mentors know that you have finished.
