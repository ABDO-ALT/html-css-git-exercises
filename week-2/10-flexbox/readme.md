# Flexbox

Flexbox is used to change the layout of elements on the HTML page. In this exercise, you'll apply the `flex-direction` property to change how the countries are displayed. Follow the steps below to complete this exercise.

1. Open `flexbox.css` and write a CSS rule to apply `display: flex` to the "container" element. _Hint: The "container" element will be the parent element of each country._
2. Use the property `flex-direction` to make the countries start from the right instead of the left.

_Hint: You can review how `flex-direction` works in [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#article-header-id-3)._

When you're finished, it should look like the image below.
