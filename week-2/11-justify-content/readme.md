# Justify Content

With flexbox, the `justify-content` property can be used to control how extra space is used. In this exercise, you'll apply a different `justify-content` property to each list. Follow the steps below to complete this exercise.

1. Apply the `justify-content` property to the _first_ list of countries, so that all the countries are shown in the middle with no space between them.
2. Apply the `justify-content` property to the _second_ list of countries, so that all the countries are shown with equal space around them.

_Hint: You can review how `justify-content` works in [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#article-header-id-6)._

When you're finished, it should look like the image below.
