# Item order

The `order` property is used to move a *specific* item to a different position in the list.

In this exercise, you'll use order to move the items in the list. Follow the steps below to complete this exercise:

1. Look at the First list of countries. Then look at the First Result displayed to the side. Find the differences between the two lists.
2. Use the order property to make the First list of countries look like the First Result list.
3. Do the same thing for the Second and Third list.
