# Align self

With `align-items` you move all the items at once (on the **non-main axis**).
With `align-self` you move only one of the items.

![Example of align-items vs. align-self](./ignore_this_folder/example1.png)

You can use the same values for `align-self` as you used for `align-items`.

In this exercise, you'll use `align-self` (together with some of the other **Flexbox** properties you learned) to align the items in the list. Follow the steps below to complete this exercise:

1. Look at the First list of countries. Then look at the First Result displayed to the side. Find the differences between the two lists.
2. Make the First list of countries look like the First Result list.
3. Do the same thing for the Second and Third list.
