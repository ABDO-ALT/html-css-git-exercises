# Item order

The `order` property is used to apply 

To do:

1. Apply the `align-items` property to the _first_ list of countries, so that all the countries are shown in the middle and left of their container.
2. Apply the `align-items` property to the _second_ list of countries, so that all the countries are shown at the bottom left of their container.

_Hint: You can review how `align-items` works in [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#article-header-id-7)._

When you're finished, it should look like the image below.
